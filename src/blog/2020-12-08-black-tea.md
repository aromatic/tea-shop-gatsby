All four types are made from leaves of the shrub (or small tree) Camellia sinensis. 
Two principal varieties of the species are used â€“ the small-leaved Chinese variety plant (C. sinensis var. sinensis), used for most other types of teas, and the large-leaved Assamese plant
(C. sinensis var. assamica), which was traditionally mainly used for black tea, although in recent years some green and white teas have been produced. 
In China, where black tea was developed, the beverage is called "red tea", due to the color of the oxidized leaves when processed appropriately.
